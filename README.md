# Decentralized Autonomous Medical Reserve (DAMR)
A Decentralized Autonomous Medical Reserve that manages national medical resources and supplies in a time of crisis. 

## The Problem
### Supply
The recent COVID-19 Pandemic has identified large gaps in supply and demand when an outbreak is identified. China, the largest maker of masks on the planet was shut down. By the time outbreaks hit other countries, no more could be produced. As China has slowly been coming back online, it's a price war to compete for new supplies.

New York City had a shortage of all kinds of supplies. Yet, stockpiles of supplies exist across the entire country. Counting every hospital, every company in existence, there is no shortage. In a national emergency, we need to connect the unused supply with the demand.

### Resources (Human)
Pandemics don't just test a community's supply chain, it tests its preparedness and it's most vital resource, our first responders. Overwhelming pressure and absent federal support has left a strain onn a system not designed to support such outbreaks. Just like supplies, the nurses, doctors and staff need re-stocked during an outbreak. Special Volunteer Reserves are called to duty from all over the country to serve and support the population. 

### Politics
Medical Care is not a weapon or a choice. No sitting president or leader shall have the power to withhold care for personal gain. In a national crisis, we need a capable medical force of the people, for the people, by the people. States should not compete against other states for PPE. Using the cooperation of Governors as an example, a DAO shall govern the focus, need, and supply of any pandemic.

### Volunteerism
Words such as "Pandemic" and "war" have associations with community action. These times call for innovation in order to leverage the power of the community. Businesses/Hospitals can donate a percentage of supplies to support a pandemic. 

Example: 
- 10 hospitals from South Dakota donated 10% of their supplies to hotspots... and every city/state did the same?
- 15,000 Nurses called to duty from Oklahoma, Wyoming and North Dakota and sent to New York city, Seattle, and Newark. 
- 2.2 Million masks donate from just 1 phase of local business and hospitals across the midwest.
- $48 Million is established for the first to deliver 50 Million Masks to both coasts.
